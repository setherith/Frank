# Frank
A FOSS cross-platform renaming tool

In Honour
---------
My smoking buddy Jim, whos actual name was Frank, but he changed it.

Manifesto
---------
* A tool that any Linux, Mac or PC user can use
..* Probably means it will be Java based :)
* Rename any file(s) or folder(s) as desired
..* Warnings and exclusion zones for dangerous areas
* More advanced options for experts
..* Raw access to RegEx rename function
