Things I want in my application
===============================
* Ability to right-click a folder or file to start the application
* A quick option that does some pre-defined steps for renaming files downloaded from the internet to something better

__Example__:

| State  | Name                                                            |
|--------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Before | Some.Tv.Program.S03E04.Title.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H.264-KiNGS.mkv  |
| After  | Some Tv Program - 03x04 - Title.mkv                             |

* A way to manipulate the files directly with regular expressions (RegEx)
* Some safe guards to prevent more inexperienced users from renaming core OS files
* History functionality, so that users can undo their changes
* Comprehensive configuration setup so that users can customise their application
